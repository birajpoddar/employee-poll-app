## PRE-REQUISITES

- NodeJS should be installed on the system
- NPM/Yarn should be installed
- Root access should be present to download/install any above tools or other additional software along with debugging the project
- An IDE/Text Editor to make changes to the code, if required

* GIT should be installed to clone the project

- A browser should be available to test out the deployed project
- Internet connectivity should be present to download the source code
- Port **3000** should not be consumed by any other software

> In case the port **3000** is used by any other software, either stop that application or change the port number of this application before firing up the app.

## QUICKSTART GUIDE

Fire up a terminal and follow along

##### First make a directory to store the codebase on your linux/mac machine

`$ mkdir <directory-name>`

`$ cd <directory-name>`

##### Clone/download the project from [here](https://github.com/birajpoddar/udacity-poll-app) and wait for some time for the process to complete

`$ git clone https://github.com/birajpoddar/udacity-poll-app.git`

##### Enter inside the project folder to fire the execution of the app

`$ cd udacity-poll-app`

##### Once on the project directory, you need to first install the node_modules and wait for sometime to finish the installation

`$ npm i` for npm users

`$ yarn install` or simpley `$ yarn` for yarn users

##### When all dependencies have been installed, fire up the app

`$ npm start` for npm users

`$ yarn run start` for yarn users

##### You can also test the application

`$ npm test` for npm users

`$ yarn run test` for yarn users

> In case no test is executed, please press `a` to run all tests.

## AVAILABLE SCRIPTS

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
